This application allows you to periodically store the data of an API in parquet formats.
You can decide the period of data storage.

To use this application:
    - clone the repository
    - cd PATH/docker_no_volume
    - define the period in the last line of "src/main.py". w = week, h = hour, m = minute. Only the smallest non-zero period is taken into account.
    - create a folder "data"
    - create a "config.ini" file with this structure (you can choice your user_name and password):

        [DEFAULT]
        user_name = user
        password = password
        url_base = https://localbitcoins.com/
    
    - To dockerize the application : docker build --tag homework .
    - To run the container : docker run -i -t homework
        - You will have to enter your username and password in the terminal
